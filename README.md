## **About Datasets & Running Code**
- ### **About Project's Datasets:**

    ### [Reddit Mental Health Dataset | Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3941387#.ZFRoFezMLyg)

    This is the central dataset of our project. It has posts across 28 subreddits, 15 of which are mental health support groups. The dataset displays helpful information of the following information: the subreddit name, the post content, different attributes related to the post content (such as word count), and the number of words related to different stressors such as economic stress, suicidality, and substance use.

    The following are datasets that require more exploration, but may also be used during the assignment to help piece    together an overall narrative that addresses the research questions above:
