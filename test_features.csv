I just ran out of what I had tonight and I'm not able to get any till Thursday. As much as I don't want to get anymore, I feel like the urge just overpowers all logical reasoning. I'm scared what will happen in the next few days. I've been diagnosed with MDD and anxiety for almost 10 years and I know the next few days are probably going to be the worst. Not many people know what's going on and the ones that do, don't know how bad it has actually become. It also doesn't help that my roommate/friend has been high out of his mind on benzos and becomes verbally/emotionally abusive. I don't know what to do.",3.2358712121212100,4.560149986111110,4.757121212121210,84.2727272727273,73.44444444444440,8.291919191919190,26.285353535353500,8.841846274778880,1.8917861111111100,554,19,115,11,11,186,86,144,0.136,0.826,0.038,-0.9174,1,0,1,1,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,0,4,5,0,2,5,0,15,2,0,2,1,27,31,11,0,1,4,0,1,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,8,11,0,0,7,0,0,3,6,4,0,1,5,1,9,1,18,24,5,19,0,0,0,0,2,7,0,1,10,73,17,0,0.14696044472994600,0.17412409585522600,0.143412194757413,0.16020857693200700,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1471596570047820,0.0,0.0,0.11752421455519100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09993814190474550,0.0,0.11242433796998200,0.0,0.1457452717226080,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12270583280762700,0.0,0.32461253021695300,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1895546582331240,0.0,0.0,0.1491617579078360,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16531071998610200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07430761652275610,0.10498857107915900,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1135412750472110,0.0,0.23034230040817700,0.0,0.16704201488961200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12995663593036900,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09850448830925990,0.15527177854549800,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3230624683036750,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0717974500362573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14899482460227600,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1483881554636930,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1080328363620040,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31258820040038500,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995842007152149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10188386833008200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15844821548204800,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15109981340989100,0.1451057097306660,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2942660852630880,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08668107791555120,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09463770811863890
