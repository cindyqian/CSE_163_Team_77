addiction,speckled_egg_,2019/04/16,"Having cravings A few years back I had a period where I did a lot of different drugs but it was usually alone and just a way to cope with my depression and feeling alone. 
I also was struggling heavily with binge eating and drugs felt like a replacement addiction. Why do I always feel like I have to be addicted to something? It’s like something in my soul seeks and needs this feeling of oblivion and loss of control otherwise I get wound too tight... 
that being said I struggled a lot with binge eating lately and gained some weight and feel isolated and idk man... those cravings are coming back. I just feel alone in the world I guess. I’m not sure what I’m looking for with this post- maybe some thoughts on what I said about addiction and if that rings true for anyone else- I feel like my mind obsesses and I feel like I need to be addicted to SOMETHING because I just can’t cope with life and feelings...",3.6873220973782800,5.654717207865180,4.086314606741580,86.90156928838960,73.5505617977528,7.6680149812734100,27.03520599250940,8.447377352677280,1.881016779026220,725,27,142,13,15,227,101,178,0.165,0.696,0.139,-0.605,1,3,5,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,3,9,12,0,3,7,0,12,11,0,1,2,45,32,14,0,3,6,0,11,5,0,0,8,3,0,1,9,17,3,2,10,0,0,1,2,5,0,0,8,15,17,7,19,21,5,14,1,2,1,0,3,5,0,6,11,91,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4203434556403080,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2995115401409990,0.0,0.07708784294443190,0.08020919055507490,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06740232152077020,0.09876908915927660,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1482451410665140,0.0,0.05876210427110100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08303661482160150,0.0,0.0,0.1081163059095390,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08302572985680430,0.0,0.0,0.10071329867780500,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22357750264684600,0.19727433780135100,0.0805264851538515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3899256944629890,0.20659595579368200,0.09255527279485800,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05036292916181940,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10619105705805200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10873888187781800,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06808734254006600,0.2354710717767230,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08094835844666700,0.0,0.0,0.16390485680280600,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09684273419572810,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09733247626026200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14295281878329500,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0923207175782915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18338933276712300,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22263104094537200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2015480490666930,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09085208515935180,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07652765305857580,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10616657055370600,0.0,0.0,0.07651465453237040,0.0,0.11738435354547200,0.0,0.0,0.08698239269259730,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06207586077203330
addiction,zaelb,2019/09/12,"Addicted to taking small amounts of drugs I started to use amphetamine on a weekly basis when i was 17 until 20. Then it got more seldom, about 1 time a month. I started using kratom and phenibut and not going out to party anymore instead. I am now 22. Almost everyday i need to take some kind of drug to feel in control and not have anxiety/worries or feel depressed.

The thing about the current drug use is that its in very low amounts. Usually about 1/4 of a regular small dose. For example today i have felt the need to use 1/4 of a 30mg codeine pill twice. Yesterday i used about 500mg kratom. The day before that 250mg phenibut, and the day before that i microdosed 0.40g shrooms. As you can see the dosages and drugs i use are neither in large amounts or especially hard. The thing is, i just cant go a day without using anything. Or well i can do it, but i get extremely tense and im not able to socialise well and it results in me feeling terrible and feeling im losing control of my life situation. 

Sometimes i can manage to delay my use by eating food, drinking tea, excercising or playing video games. 

I have social anxiety and depression diagnosed and eat 20 mg fluoxetine per day fyi",4.065343691148780,5.586516165254240,5.223333333333330,80.9662052730697,71.66949152542370,8.295291902071560,32.1789077212806,8.841846274778880,2.7581947269303200,949,45,181,18,18,314,140,236,0.113,0.8270000000000000,0.06,-0.9369,1,0,5,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,0,3,10,9,0,0,12,0,13,14,0,11,0,42,37,19,0,2,10,0,6,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,11,5,3,5,4,0,2,6,5,2,1,3,7,18,4,28,34,6,30,0,4,1,0,3,9,0,6,19,109,27,1,0.08538601193191350,0.0,0.0,0.09308335645451270,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08550175696594200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06532006541612170,0.0,0.08467997993061860,0.0,0.0,0.07026541246024520,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1453144143542340,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1915353458032090,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22026765555024500,0.0,0.14708569391921600,0.08666500474946110,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08364578489902940,0.3960826623054570,0.1747424136951900,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1726949327814940,0.0,0.08198396176940290,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10324910455835500,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04461066705674640,0.0,0.09705367660464710,0.0,0.06829099390258650,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07648909516903880,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18446309039935800,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08891639187356270,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06031066539188170,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0955251064558236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06815430009398200,0.0,0.0,0.1266252918505700,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06804159654550310,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09597745494512920,0.0,0.08704028625054950,0.0,0.0,0.08444894911533410,0.0,0.12087331744960000,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283993091050010,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11345334448163600,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04978927021361740,0.0,0.08093595538713500,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5899687933430880,0.09404062889810040,0.07045240219040570,0.0,0.0,0.06849150836693770,0.0,0.15354455834916600,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08230906849542320,0.0,0.0,0.08671363985251000,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,Bellgenius,2019/09/12,"The harsh truth. When I was a child I played video games, to the point nothing mattered. I didn't exist when I was playing Tony Hawk' Undergound 2 and I was kick flipping and railing about. I thought it was just fun and growing up around technology. But as a adult I completely see it was 'addiction'. I couldn't stop it was my escape. Later on in life I got involved with weed which transgressed to current day cocaine. I believe if I never got involved with drugs, I could of amassed to something great. 

As a addict when we pursue something we do it full pledge, not like the ordinary man. When I want cocaine I will get it by any means possible. I will get into heaps of debt to get that euphoric feeling which also is my worst enemy. 

I've come to the realisation that the truth is, I will always be a addict. I cant change that, those were the cards I was dealt when I was made to be.

But my mistake is that I got involved with drugs and my addiction instantly stamped that with ADDICTED.

It's my own fault, I take full pledge I am not going to moan about it no more or cry. Life will always continue and this is a learning curve. If people who have been here before and reached sobriety. Why can't I?

Life as a addict isn't going to be a bliss walk through the heavenly gates of oblivion. It's about making the right move. It's about thinking more logic. Like a squid will get attached to any surface but is free in the ocean. As addicts we must find that open sea.

addiction,fredleam1,2019/06/13,"10 Things You Need to Know if You’re the Parent (of family member) of an Addict I shared this yesterday in /AlAnon. I'm sharing it here because I know lots of parents (including me) peruse this site to learn about addiction and to know how to deal with their son, daughter or another close family member.  

I'm not trying to offend or judge anyone fighting addiction. Addiction is awful for the addict and the family. We're all trying to get through it.  I'm sharing our experience. That may not work for anyone else. My goal is to help family members avoid the mistakes we made. 

*Here's what I posted yesterday:*

My son is a recovering heroin addict. On May 27, he was one-year sober. His addiction lasted almost 12 years before he got clean.

During those years, he was in and out of county jails and served 33 months in the state penitentiary. As anyone here knows, the journey for family members can be brutal. Ours certainly was. Like many of you here, my wife and I wish we knew when we discovered his addiction what we know now.

I've thought a lot about that and whittled the lessons we've learned to a list of 10. The list could be much, much longer. I put it together in the following article:

[10 Things You Need to Know if You’re the Parent of an Addict](https://moneywithapurpose.com/if-youre-the-parent-of-an-addict/)

We attended Al-Anon along the way and found them very helpful. At the top of the list are the 3 C's of Al-Anon. It took us a long time to get these into our heads and implement. Fortunately, in time, we did.

I hope these things help parents and family members avoid the many mistakes we made along the way.",3.958461538461540,5.905369598726120,4.941019108280260,81.14826065654090,72.7579617834395,8.39764821166095,25.452719255267000,9.057496981413340,2.042732876041160,1290,42,246,28,26,421,161,314,0.07,0.825,0.105,0.8474,5,2,0,0,2,0,58.0,11,3,2,4,9,13,3,2,22,1,14,9,1,3,2,59,37,16,0,9,6,8,0,1,0,2,8,0,1,0,16,22,0,2,12,0,0,5,2,7,0,0,11,0,28,6,38,21,5,32,0,0,0,0,37,12,0,10,12,145,44,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6860741820419130,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06301937339595280,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06599185249065200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13201488064462900,0.06448338485751130,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03836402073770390,0.0,0.053552252392026600,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050247728400313100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06488225563877850,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05257333420403200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06156158981940810,0.3559718022595180,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06900395183765950,0.0,0.0,0.06576090093239790,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050334119403442400,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06458850522632300,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1265501277242750,0.0,0.0,0.06250772488098800,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20752149129689100,0.05129966113042570,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030746404312189600,0.0,0.0,0.05569466543099510,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10700857982183700,0.0,0.11909946438930900,0.0,0.12761052419917300,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050233368746718600,0.0,0.09252755534079250,0.09332962071973820,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04264574990824920,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3494041466852750,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06027343587549380,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06326611592827940,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254317852513120,0.0,0.0,0.04996261630458460,0.07339471660105860,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06992205975733600,0.08545619549969200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07570192905196040,0.0,0.0,0.051927193052273300,0.0,0.09990825991103020,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07237106668333060,0.0,0.0,0.04581674748360500,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12158241980148000
